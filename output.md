## Question vid-sAhit7IE

![Figure](/sat/assets/imgs/vid-sAhit7IE.png)

The graph represents the total charge, in dollars, by an electrician for $x$ hours of work. The electrician charges a onetime fee plus an hourly rate. What is the best interpretation of the slope of the graph?

A. The electrician’s hourly rate

B. The electrician’s onetime fee

C. The maximum amount that the electrician charges

D. The total amount that the electrician charges

## Rationale

Choice A is correct. It’s given that the electrician charges a onetime fee plus an hourly rate. It’s also given that the graph represents the total charge, in dollars, for $x$ hours of work. This graph shows a linear relationship in the $xy$-plane. Thus, the total charge $y$, in dollars, for $x$ hours of work can be represented as $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and 0, $b$ is the y-intercept of the graph of the equation in the $xy$-plane. Since the given graph represents the total charge, in dollars, by an electrician for $x$ hours of work, it follows that its slope is $m$, or the electrician’s hourly rate.
Choice B is incorrect. The electrician’s onetime fee is represented by the y-coordinate of the y-intercept, not the slope of the graph. Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors.

## Question vid-2psZBBMS

What length, in centimeters, is equivalent to a length of 51 meters? (1 meter = 100 centimeters)

A. 0.051
B. 0.51
C. 5,100
D. 51,000

## Rationale

Choice C is correct. Since 1 meter is equal to 100 centimeters, 51 meters is equal to $51 \times \frac{100 \text{ centimeters}}{1 \text{ meter}}$, or 5,100 centimeters.

## Question vid-PXqMp1lx

What is the length of one side of a square that has the same area as a circle with radius $2$?

A. $2$

B. $\sqrt{2\pi}$

C. $2 \times \sqrt{\pi}$

D. $2\pi$

## Rationale

Choice C is correct. The area $A$ of a circle with radius $r$ is given by the formula $A = \pi r^2$. Thus, a circle with radius $2$ has area $\pi(2^2)$, which can be rewritten as $4\pi$. The area of a square with side length $s$ is given by the formula $A = s^2$. Thus, if a square has the same area as a circle with radius $2$, then $s^2 = 4\pi$. Since the side length of a square must be a positive number, taking the square root of both sides of $s^2 = 4\pi$ gives $s = \sqrt{4\pi}$. Using the properties of square roots, $\sqrt{4\pi}$ can be rewritten as $\sqrt{4}\sqrt{\pi}$, which is equivalent to $2\sqrt{\pi}$. Therefore, $s = 2\sqrt{\pi}$.

Choice A is incorrect. The side length of the square isn’t equal to the radius of the circle. Choices B and D are incorrect and may result from incorrectly simplifying the expression $\sqrt{4\pi}$.

## Question vid-M8hISIxJ

\[\begin{aligned} y &= 4x-9, \\ y &= 19 \end{aligned}\] What is the solution $(x,y)$ to the given system of equations?

A. $(4, 19)$
B. $(7, 19)$
C. $(19, 4)$
D. $(19, 7)$

## Rationale

Correct Answer: B

Choice B is correct. It's given by the second equation in the system that $y=19$. Substituting 19 for $y$ in the first equation yields $19=4x-9$. Adding 9 to both sides of this equation yields $28=4x$. Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields $7=x$. Therefore, since $x=7$ and $y=19$, the solution $x, y$ to the given system of equations is $7, 19$.

Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

## Question vid-Lqw6a4Vf

In the equation above, what is the value of $x$?\n\nA. 25\nB. 24\nC. 16\nD. 15

## Rationale

Choice A is correct. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 5 results in $4x = 100$. Dividing both sides of the resulting equation by 4 results in $x = 25$.\n\nChoice B is incorrect and may result from adding 20 and 4. Choice C is incorrect and may result from dividing 20 by 5 and then multiplying the result by 4. Choice D is incorrect and may result from subtracting 5 from 20.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Easy.

## Question vid-Ql2zHMhu

If $x = 40$, what is the value of $x + 6$?

A. 34

B. 40

C. 46

D. 64

## Rationale

Choice C is correct. It's given that $x = 40$. Adding 6 to both sides of this equation yields $x + 6 = 40 + 6$, or $x + 6 = 46$. Therefore, the value of $x + 6$ is 46.

Choice A is incorrect. This is the value of $x - 6$, not $x + 6$. Choice B is incorrect. This is the value of $x$, not $x + 6$. Choice D is incorrect. This is the value of $x + 24$, not $x + 6$.

## Question vid-SwClOplQ

The side lengths of right triangle $RST$ are given. Triangle $RST$ is similar to triangle $UVW$, where $S$ corresponds to $V$ and $T$ corresponds to $W$. What is the value of $\tan W$?\n\n$ RS = 440 $\n\n$ ST = 384 $\n\n$ TR = 584 $\n\nA. $\frac{48}{73}$\n\nB. $\frac{55}{73}$\n\nC. $\frac{48}{55}$\n\nD. $\frac{55}{48}$\n\n### Answer\n\nThe correct answer is D.\n\n### Rationale\nChoice D is correct. The hypotenuse of triangle $RST$ is the longest side and is across from the right angle. The longest side length given is 584, which is the length of side $TR$. Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle $RST$ is side $TR$, so the right angle is angle $S$. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side, which is the side across from the angle, to the length of the adjacent side, which is the side closest to the angle that is not the hypotenuse. It follows that the opposite side of angle $T$ is side $RS$ and the adjacent side of angle $T$ is side $ST$. Therefore, $\tan T = \frac{RS}{ST}$. Substituting 440 for $RS$ and 384 for $ST$ in this equation yields $\tan T = \frac{440}{384}$. This is equivalent to $\tan T = \frac{55}{48}$. It's given that triangle $RST$ is similar to triangle $UVW$, where $S$ corresponds to $V$ and $T$ corresponds to $W$. It follows that $R$ corresponds to $U$. Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle $UVW$ is side $WU$, which means $\tan W = \frac{UV}{VW}$. Since the lengths of corresponding sides of similar triangles are proportional, $\frac{RS}{ST} = \frac{UV}{VW}$. Therefore, $\tan W = \frac{UV}{VW}$ is equivalent to $\tan W = \frac{RS}{ST}$, or $\tan W = \tan T$. Thus, $\tan W = \frac{55}{48}$. \n\nChoice A is incorrect. This is the value of $\cos W$, not $\tan W$.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. This is the value of $\sin W$, not $\tan W$.\n\nChoice C is incorrect. This is the value of $\frac{1}{\tan W}$, not $\tan W$.\n\nQuestion Difficulty: Hard.

## Question vid-2XxGhiCW

How many yards are equivalent to 612 inches? (1 yard = 36 inches)

A. 0.059
B. 17
C. 576
D. 22,032

## Rationale

Choice B is correct. It’s given that 1 yard = 36 inches. Therefore, 612 inches is equivalent to 612 inches \(\times \frac{1 \text{ yard}}{36 \text{ inches}}\), which can be rewritten as $\frac{612\text{ yards}}{36}$, or 17 yards.
